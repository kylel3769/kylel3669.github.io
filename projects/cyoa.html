            <h1 class="margin text-center">CYOA project</h1>
            <h2>Context:</h2>
            <p>My teacher, Mr Mueller, told my class to pick three subject from the subjects the class brainstormed a few 
            minutes before. Mr Mueller then put the class into partners based on the subjects we have chosen. 
            The subject is was given was about working at a pizza place. Me and my partner immeditly chose to title our project, CYOA pizza place as we wanted to make it as simple as possible. On the halfway of the project, my first semester at school has ended and me and my partner were put in different periods of our computer science class. We tried our best to communicate via slack about our progress on the project.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>We have been learning about using git inside a IDE and how to use it to merge committed changes on the same repo with a partner. During the project, me and my partner had to push our commits from our IDE to the github and then tell each other to pull the commit back into our remote IDE. This conversation would usually happenned online. I have also learned about merge conflicts and how to deal with them. I had to deal with many merge conflicts during my project maining because I was getting too impataint with my partner and tried editing his work. These conflicts were usually able to be dealt with by pressing ctrl+x.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>A big challenge me and my partner encountered while working on our project was that we weren't communicating enough to each other online. This led to me getting impatient and trying to do my partners agreed on work which led to a merge conflict and wasted time we could have used to improve our project. Another challenge me and my partner stumbled apon was that we felt that our project didn't have enough work and ended up having to add random things to our story. We could have gone around this challenge by making our story bigger when making the project. Despite encountering these challenges, me and my partner felt like we did good on our project and believe we would get a high grade from the teacher. We also believe that our project would have improved if we were actually seated together during the whole project so that we could work together on the project at the same time/</p>
